Mobidia is a revolutionary mobile data wallet that transforms unused bandwidth into a digital asset. Users can sell or lend leftover gigabytes through smart contracts, creating a decentralized bandwidth marketplace. Beyond trading, Mobidia introduces a novel concept of on-chain mobile data mining—users share anonymized device data (like location patterns or app usage) using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to protect privacy. In return, they earn token rewards proportionate to their contributions. Governed by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), Mobidia enables users to vote on how shared data is used, sold, or protected, ensuring transparency and community control. By converting bandwidth into currency and data into value, Mobidia empowers digitally-native communities to build local economies, foster data sovereignty, and contribute to civic infrastructure. Perfectly aligned with the ethos of Crypto Cities, Mobidia bridges real-world telecom infrastructure with Web3, enabling a new era of user-owned connectivity and privacy-respecting economic participation.



Inspiration Story 

In many parts of the world, people lose unused mobile data every month,silent losses in value. We asked: What if unused bandwidth could become a tradable asset? What if mobile users could earn from their data while protecting their privacy? Born from this thought, Mobidia empowers people to sell or lend their leftover gigabytes and mine tokens by sharing anonymized device usage through zero-knowledge proofs. It transforms smartphones into income-generating tools, especially in data-first economies. Mobidia is a step toward digital sovereignty, where connectivity becomes currency and users control the data economy.

Project Overview 

Mobidia is a mobile data wallet and decentralized infrastructure protocol that transforms unused mobile bandwidth into a tokenized asset and allows users to mine rewards through privacy-preserving data sharing. Built on Base blockchain, Mobidia introduces two major systems:

Bandwidth Marketplace: Users list leftover mobile data to sell or lend, with smart contracts handling access, payment, and expiry.

ZK Data Mining DAO: Users earn tokens by sharing anonymized location and usage statistics, secured by zero-knowledge proofs.

Governance is powered by a DAO that decides how shared data is utilized (e.g., sold to telecoms, civic use, or research). The protocol protects users’ privacy and ensures data value returns to the community.

Mobidia aligns with Crypto Cities' values empowering local economies, enhancing governance infrastructure, and enabling public goods through citizen-owned mobile infrastructure. It’s more than a tool it’s a gateway to on-chain digital inclusion.

Problem  Statement

Billions of gigabytes of unused mobile data expire every month globally, especially in developing regions where mobile data is expensive. Simultaneously, telecoms, researchers, and smart cities crave access to mobile data insights, yet users are excluded from the data economy. Moreover, most data collection systems are opaque, centralized, and breach user privacy. There’s no incentive or control for the user. This digital waste and inequity create a disconnect between infrastructure value and ownership. The current model doesn’t reward users for what they pay for or for the data trails they generate daily.

Solution Statement

Mobidia enables users to tokenize unused mobile data, turning it into a tradable resource on-chain. Users can sell or lend leftover GBs using smart contracts, earning value instead of letting it expire. Additionally, Mobidia introduces a ZK-enabled mobile data mining system, allowing users to share anonymized data (e.g., usage stats, movement patterns) and receive token rewards. Privacy is preserved through zero-knowledge proofs, and the ecosystem is governed by a DAO to ensure ethical use and reward distribution. This creates a transparent, user-owned infrastructure layer where connectivity, privacy, and participation converge.

Goal Statement 

Mobidia’s goal is to empower digital citizens to earn from their mobile bandwidth and data while protecting their privacy and promoting public good. We aim to create a global decentralized data economy where users become stakeholders, not just consumers. By using blockchain to tokenize unused data and democratize data monetization, Mobidia fosters local wealth creation, transparent governance, and privacy-first infrastructure. We envision a future where mobile data is no longer wasted or exploited but becomes currency, capital, and civic power especially in regions with limited access to traditional finance or data markets.

Base Blockchain Integration 

Mobidia is built on Base, a secure, EVM-compatible L2 by Coinbase. We leverage Base to handle:

Smart Contracts for Bandwidth Trading: Users list their unused GBs, which are tokenized and traded on Base. The contract holds funds in escrow until data is confirmed delivered via mobile API integration.

Data Mining Token Rewards: Every successful ZK data contribution triggers a reward payout in MOBI tokens, issued on Base.

Governance DAO: DAO proposals and voting systems are managed through on-chain governance contracts deployed on Base.

Low-Cost Transactions: Since microtransactions are essential (e.g., selling 500MB), Base’s low gas fees are critical for accessibility.

Base enables Mobidia to scale rapidly, remain user-friendly, and support the real-time, high-frequency interactions required for a functional mobile data economy. It also positions Mobidia to benefit from Coinbase’s broader ecosystem for adoption and security.



Mobidia in Governance Infrastructure

Mobidia introduces a mobile-native governance model through its DAO. Users vote on:

What data types are shared (e.g., location, usage, signal strength).

Who can access anonymized datasets (cities, researchers, NGOs).

Reward distribution models.

Each action is transparent and on-chain, encouraging participatory digital governance and ethical data monetization. Local communities can form sub-DAOs to manage regional data economies, giving governance back to citizens in a decentralized, mobile-first way.



 Mobidia in Local Economies

Mobidia allows users in data-driven economies (especially developing nations) to:

Sell unused mobile data, earning tokens.

Monetize their mobility and behavior patterns, via anonymized contributions.

Join local bandwidth DAOs and co-manage their region’s data marketplace.

It democratizes access to micro-earnings and helps locals generate wealth from what they already have—connectivity. For crypto cities, this creates a base-layer economy powered by citizen bandwidth and behavior, unlocking inclusive digital income streams.

Mobidia in Public Goods & Civic Tech

Cities, NGOs, or governments can use anonymized Mobidia data to:

Improve transport, traffic, and urban planning.

Monitor signal quality in underserved zones.

Power open data dashboards while preserving privacy.

All data contributions are voted on through the DAO and sold with permission. Mobidia ensures the public benefits from the infrastructure they support—bridging civic needs with ethical data sharing.

Mobidia as a Wildcard Experimental Project

Mobidia is wildcard because:

It introduces a new economic layer based on bandwidth—a commodity never before tokenized at scale.

It combines DePIN, DAO, and ZK privacy, a rare intersection of cutting-edge tech.

It transforms mobile devices into mining tools, without draining battery or breaching privacy.

It's applicable everywhere mobile data exists—which is virtually the entire world.

In short, Mobidia redefines what a wallet, miner, and citizen can be. It’s bold, unconventional, and powerful the kind of wild idea that can reshape how we value connectivity in Web3.



Mobidia may seem tailored for mobile-data-dependent regions, but in reality, it holds strategic value even for advanced countries that primarily use Wi-Fi or cloud data. 

How Mobidia Reshapes Advanced Countries

1. Turns Passive Infrastructure into Tokenized Capital

Even in countries where unlimited Wi-Fi or enterprise data clouds are dominant (e.g., U.S., South Korea, Germany), data networks still generate:

Idle bandwidth

User movement and behavior data

Household or institutional device patterns

Mobidia allows this passive digital activity to be monetized and governed by individuals and communities through tokenization and DAO participation.

2. Unlocks Civic Intelligence via Privacy-Respecting Data

Advanced countries thrive on data for public services, but lack privacy-preserving systems. Mobidia’s ZK-enabled data mining offers:

Safe public transport planning

Heatmaps for internet inequality

Disaster detection (crowd movement, signal drops)

Urban health metrics without surveillance

Mobidia enables crowd-powered civic intelligence while still respecting GDPR-level privacy.

3. Builds Micro-Economies Around Local Connectivity

Even with Wi-Fi, there's value in:

Selling idle enterprise data packets (cafes, libraries, events)

Creating microbandwidth marketplaces (e.g., local ISPs or co-ops)

Forming neighborhood-based DAOs to manage bandwidth as a shared resource

This democratizes digital value—even where bandwidth seems abundant.

 How Mobidia Impacts & Empowers Advanced Countries

 1. Empowering Individuals

Students and Gig Workers earn from anonymized usage and data trails.

Remote workers can trade unused mobile/Wi-Fi capacity with others (e.g., digital nomads in co-working spaces).

 2. Empowering Communities

Neighborhoods create DAO-driven mesh bandwidth cooperatives.

Citizens vote on what anonymized data is shared with governments or researchers and get rewarded.

 3. Empowering Institutions

Universities or hospitals monetize anonymized infrastructure data securely.

City planners use community-submitted movement data without compromising privacy.

 Use Case Studies

 Germany – Smart Mobility Without Surveillance

Mobidia helps German cities collect ZK-anonymized foot traffic and transport data from mobile users, without violating strict EU privacy laws. Citizens vote via DAO to share insights with Deutsche Bahn (railways) or local transit. They are paid in tokens for their contributions, which fund community Wi-Fi expansion in underserved areas.

  United States – Library Bandwidth DAO

Public libraries in underserved cities (e.g., Detroit) list their idle Wi-Fi capacity for community use via Mobidia. Locals "lease" GBs when their own plans run out. The DAO collects usage fees, which are then reinvested to upgrade digital literacy tools or fund hotspots for low-income households.

  Japan – Disaster-Aware DAO

Japan uses Mobidia to collect decentralized device movement data during earthquakes or floods, letting city officials quickly locate movement slowdowns or drop-offs without tracking individuals. Data miners (users) are rewarded, and their contribution powers AI-driven emergency responses—all done on-chain, governed by the public.

 UK – Wi-Fi Sharing for Events

At large UK festivals (e.g., Glastonbury), Mobidia enables Wi-Fi-sharing between attendees. Users offer bandwidth on-chain via P2P contracts. Others can rent it securely. This creates a temporary bandwidth microeconomy, while anonymized movement data helps improve future event planning.
